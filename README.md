The Ball and Beam project is a control system problem that aims to keep a ball balanced at a specific position on a horizontal beam. 
In this project, the beam is placed horizontally and a ball can move freely on it. 
A distance sensor is often used to detect the position of the ball on the beam. 
The sensor measures the instantaneous position of the ball and transmits this information to the control system.
A servo motor or similar actuator is used to control the angle of the beam. The motor controls the movement of the ball by changing the inclination of the beam. 
The central part of the project is the control algorithm implemented using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. 
The control system moves the motor at the right angle based on the position information from the sensor and ensures that the ball remains balanced in the desired position.
